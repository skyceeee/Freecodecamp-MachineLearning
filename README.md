🧠 FreeCodeCamp - Machine Learning with Python Projects
This repository contains solutions to the required projects from the freeCodeCamp Machine Learning with Python Certification.

Each project is organized in its own folder or notebook.

📁 Projects
🎮 Rock, Paper, Scissors AI Bot
A Python bot that learns and adapts to beat rule-based opponents in Rock-Paper-Scissors with at least 60% accuracy using pattern recognition.

Highlights:

✅ Tracks opponent move patterns

✅ Predicts next move

✅ Beats 4 different bots with >60% win rate

✅ Challenge passed (tested with play() and test_module.py)

Files:
rps_project/rps.py, rps_project/main.py

🐱🐶 Cats vs Dogs - Image Classifier
