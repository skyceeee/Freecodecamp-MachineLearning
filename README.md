## 📁 Projects

### 🎮 Rock, Paper, Scissors AI Bot

A Python bot that learns and adapts to beat rule-based opponents in Rock-Paper-Scissors with at least **60% accuracy** using pattern recognition.

- ✅ Tracks opponent move patterns  
- ✅ Predicts next move  
- ✅ Beats 4 different bots with >60% win rate  
- ✅ Challenge passed (tested with `play()` and `test_module.py`)  
- 📓 File: `RPS.py`, `main.py`

### 🐱🐶 Cats vs Dogs - Image Classifier *(Coming Soon)*

A convolutional neural network (CNN) model built with TensorFlow/Keras to classify cat and dog images with at least **63% accuracy** (bonus for >70%).

- 🔄 Currently in progress  
- 📂 Notebook uploaded  
- 🧪 Model training pending  
- 📓 File: `cats-vs-dogs/fcc_cat_dog.ipynb`
