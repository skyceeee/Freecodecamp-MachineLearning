## 🎮 Rock, Paper, Scissors - AI Bot

This project is part of the freeCodeCamp Machine Learning with Python curriculum.  
The goal is to build an AI bot that can play rock-paper-scissors and win at least **60%** of games against multiple predefined opponents.

### 🚀 Project Overview
- ✅ Tracks opponent move patterns
- ✅ Predicts next move
- ✅ Beats 4 different bots with >60% win rate
- ✅ Challenge passed (tested with `play()` and `test_module.py`)

📂 **Files:** `rps_project/rps.py`, `rps_project/main.py`
