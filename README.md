# ðŸ§  Rock, Paper, Scissors - AI Bot ðŸŽ®

This project is part of the [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) *Machine Learning with Python* curriculum. The goal is to build an AI bot that can play rock-paper-scissors and win **at least 60%** of games against multiple predefined opponents.

## ðŸš€ Project Overview

The core of the project is in the `RPS.py` file, which contains a `player` function that:

- Analyzes the opponentâ€™s previous moves
- Uses pattern recognition based on the last few moves
- Predicts the opponentâ€™s next move
- Returns the counter-move that would win

## ðŸ§  Strategy

- Pattern detection based on the last 3 opponent moves
- Frequency-based prediction for next likely move
- Dynamically adapts to different opponent strategies

## ðŸ§ª Testing

Unit tests are included in the `test_module.py` file. You can also test the bot by running the following in `main.py`:
